          <h4><p class="sansserif">Sree Sathrughna Swami Temple is situated at Methiri near Palai, located about 40 km from Kottayam and is well connected by bus. Devottees can reach here from Koothattukulam in M.C road. Main deity is Rama. This temple is managed by a Temple Trust called Koodappulam Devaswom of 3 Nampoothiri families on rotation, viz. Amanakara mana, Kunnoor mana and Karanattu mana.</p>
		  <p>Nalambalam is a set of four Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Ram and his brothers of Ramayana. The Nalambalams in Ramapuram Kottayam are within a radius of just 3.5 km. The devotees first visit Lord Rama at Sreerama Temple, Ramapuram, Lord Bharatha in Amanakara Temple, Lord Lakshmana in Koodapulam Temple and Lord Shatrugna in Methiri Temple. Having the Darshan of four brothers in a same day is called “Nalambala Darshanam”. Visiting Ramapuram Sreerama Temple during the period of Karkitakam (July – August) as part of Nalambala Yatra is considered to be very auspicious.</p>
		  <p> The deities here are the four sons of King Dasaratha of Ramayana. Lord Ram, the eldest of them is the eighth avatar (incarnation) of Lord Vishnu, who is the Supreme God of the Hindus. Bharata , second amongst them, is the avatar of the Panchajanya (Conch held by Vishnu) .Lakshmana is the avatar of the Adisesha, the serpent of infinite measures and on whom Lord Vishnu sleeps in the Ocean of Milk. Satrughna (the One who is destroyer of enemies) is the twin bother to Lakshamana and the youngest .He is the avatar of the Sudarshana chakra held by Lord Vishnu. Bharatha is considered as a great ruler and hence the Balikkal pura of the temple was the court of this village. Bharatha idol is facing west direction. In the north side, we can see a Shiva Temple which is facing the east direction.
Visiting nalambalam is considered to be a sacred event during the Malayalam month Karkidakam. Nalambalam consists of temples of brothers Sri Rama, Bharatha, Lakshmana & Sathrughnan.</p>

		  <h2>Temple Features</h2>
		  <h4><p>To the right of the idol of Lord Bharatha is the idol of Shiva Parvathi. Near to this is the idol of Sree Dharma Sastha. Other deities (Upadevathas) worshipped at Koodappulam Lakshamana Temple are Goddess Bhadrakali, Lakshmi Bhagavathi, Maha Ganapathi, Sree Ayappan, and Nagaraja. Bhadrakali is worshipped in a fearful form with the beheaded head of Darika, the demon. To the southern side of the Kali temple is the idols of Nagas (serpents) where during the day of Aayilyam devotees offer milk, turmeric and rice to the snakes. There is a small Ganapathi temple to the Western side of the temple and is believed to be very powerful. Appam, ada, coconut are main offerings of Ganesha. The shrine of Lord Hanuman is at the entrance of the temple. Lord Hanuman Swamy is worshipped for physical fitness, and intelligence. The shrine of Rekshas and Yakshi are installed near to Hanuman temple.
         Ambalakkulam or the temple pond is in the northern side of the temple and there is 6 day festival during the Malayalam month of Vrichikam (June – July).Punam, Puthiyidam and Tamaramangalam Illams are the Oornama Nampoothiri Families. Now the temple is managed by Kerala Kshethra Samrakshana Samithi.
This is the only temple dedicated to Lord Shatrughna in Kottayam.It is situated at Methiri in Ramapuram Panchayat which is 4 kms from the Sree Rama temple at Ramapuram. The temple is haven of peace and sanctity and a devotee experiences an unique sense of satisfaction after praying in this abode. The Shatrughna Temple is the fourth temple which devotees visit when they embark on the Nalambalam (Four Temples) yatra or visit. Visiting nalambalam is considered to be a sacred event during the Malayalam month of Karkidakam. Nalambalam Yathra is a religious journey popular in Kerala. This journey is connected with the visit to four temples namely, Sree Rama Temple at Ramapuram, Bharatha Temple at Amanakara, Lakshmana Temple at Koodappulam and Sree Shatrughna Temple at Methiri.
<p> Nalambala Darsanam is four well-known temples in central Kerala during the Malayalam month of Karkkidakam (July 17 to August 16). Nalambala Darsanam involves offering prayers at the Triprayar Sree Rama Temple, Irinjalakuda Koodalmanikyam Temple, Moozhikkulam Lakshmana Temple, and Payammal Shathrughna Temple, which are dedicated to Lord Rama, Bharatha, Lakshmana and Shathrughna respectively, on a single day. Karkkidakam is the last month of Malayalam Era. Salient feature of Karkkidakam is that it is period of famine and illness. To overcome sufferings people resort to medical treatment and spiritual enrichment. A special way of living and worship of Rama is the general trend of the period. Chanting of Ramamantra and recitation of Adyatma Ramayanam Kilippattu written by Thunchathu Ezhuthachan echoes in each and every house. To get rid of the difficulties of this month, people of Thrissur region started the Nalambalm pilgrimage centuries ago. It’s origin was at a time when vehicles were not available and pilgrimage to these four temples – as a ritual it had to be completed within one day between daybreak and noon - was an ardent task, yet devotees did it right out of their deep devotion. Great pains earned them great gains. Now these four temples are well connected with roads. It has become very easy now to visit these temples in a single day. Tens of thousands of pilgrims from different parts of the State will visit these temples every year during Karkkidakam. These temples also attract devotees from neighbouring States.</p>
